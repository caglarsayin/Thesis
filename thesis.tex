\chapter*{Abstract}

Have you ever realize how secure and safe environment they claim in security product companies' advertisement? Does Anti-Malware software really provide 100 percent security against Malware? As Everybody knows, It is not. Today, it is nothing more than cat and dog fight. Malware authors purpose an new architecture, an new approach and Anti Virus companies just try to fix vulnerabilities. Due to this fact, Parallel and concurrent architectures are elusive field for malware. They are new, trendy, popular, complex. 

In this thesis, we will try to show vulnerabilities on concurrent and parallel cpu schedulers and non-uniform memory architecture. The weaknesses on hardware layer of the computer are hard to be observed by software solution. Therefore; It is time to pay attention for them, since it is not hard to predict that attackers will focus them.

This thesis purpose an offensive security approach, how malware can be evade autonomous malware detection systems, and also purpose and experimental method to detect and mitigate them. 

\chapter*{Preface}

I would like to thank Erik Hjelm√•s for encouraging me to write this
small \LaTeX\ class for GUC's master's theses, and in particular for
making sure that I will not be responsible for maintaining and
supporting it\dots

\chapter*{Ethical and legal considerations}

The content of this document could be used in order to malicious purpose, but any matter or information could be misused in the life and ignorance is not known well as a defense strategy. In this purpose, this thesis aims to enlighten security specialist and system developers against recent way of the possible attacks. 

However, in order to act ethical responsibility, we tried to eliminate practice of tools and piece of codes which could leads malicious usage. In any case, there is no doubt that it is critical to discover and publish vulnerabilities which could cause deep impact before malicious people discover and abuse them.
